//    by deleting the outlets above - because we don't need them anymore - we are causing a crash

//        swoosh.frame = CGRect(x: view.frame.size.width / 2 - swoosh.frame.size.width / 2, y: 50, width: swoosh.frame.size.width, height: swoosh.frame.size.height)
//
//        // x: view.frame.size.width / 2 --> will get the size of the frame of the view, divide it by 2 to get the center and make it the X position
//        // x: view.frame.size.width / 2 - swoosh.frame.size.width / 2 --> since the 0,0 position for X, Y is at the top right corner, if we don't have the "- swoosh.frame.size.width / 2" it will not properly center the image at the correct center of the screen
//        // y is 50 meaning it will be 50 pixels from the top of the view
//        // we're making it so that the width and the height of the logo won't change

//        bgImg.frame = view.frame
